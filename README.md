# highly-composite

Functions related to highly composite numbers, such as to check whether an integer has more factors than any lower integer and to show an array of highly composite numbers up to a given number.

## Usage

The program is interpreted using the GNU APL interpreter:

`apl -s -f highly-composite.apl`

The output of the first function will be a one or a zero depending on whether the integer is a highly composite number.

The output of the second function will be an array of highly composite numbers up to a given number.
